# Snake
A replica of the classic arcade game Snake

The Game is purely written in JavaScript and uses no engine or external libraries.
The Game controls are the arrow keys.

The code is not very complicated as it was developed in less than an hour and the code contains detailed comments
about what each line of the code does.
